4,"The best people are staying, so I'm not super worried",1
5,And we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol,1
6,"The media constantly writing about Twitter is driving usage to all-time highs, so it's fine by me!",1
7,Cybertruck is something special that comes along once in a long while,1
8,"Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.  Somehow, other countries do just fine without class-action law.",0
9,The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.,0
10,We're working on something that should rank replies automatically,1
11,"SBF is ineffective altruism, but they thought he was saying he was in effective altruism. Easy misunderstanding.",0
12,Coverage of FTX meltdown is incomparably faster *and* better quality on Twitter than old-school media,1
13,"Correct. I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.",1
14,People have no idea how fast Twitter will evolve,1
15,Model S received the highest overall score from Euro NCAP among any vehicle tested under the current protocol,1
16,"Wait a second, how do we know you're not an alien body snatcher pretending to be Jimmy!?   Say something that only the real Jimmy would say",0
17,"To heir is human, to forgive, divine (something like that)",1
18,"LIVE NOW: The Artemis era of exploration begins today with  I, the first integrated test flight of the rocket",1
19,"The Guardian used to have balance (moderately left) and integrity, but now it is a far left wing propaganda machine. I hope they get back to where they were one day.",0
20,"My apologies, this will be fixed within a week, two at most",0
21,Agreed. What will matter in the future is how many Verified followers you have.,1
22,Hard to say who's celeb & who isn't. Being able to sort by follower count & disallowing deliberate impersonation probably solves this.,1
23,All unpaid legacy Blue checkmarks will be removed in a few months,0
24,"With new release, changing your verified name will cause loss of checkmark until name is confirmed by Twitter to meet Terms of Service",0
25,Punting relaunch of Blue Verified to November 29th to make sure that it is rock solid,1
26,"Much appreciated, SpaceX will not let NASA down!",1
27,Important to admit when I'm wrong & firing them was truly one of my biggest mistakes,0
28,"This is just as a result of people living longer. Population collapse is already built-in, due to dramatically decreasing birth rates.",0
29,I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.,0
30,Server control team knows because they stop working from time to time. That’s why they have the “critical 40” list.,0
31,"True. Server side can (and has been) brute-forced, but that can't solve weak Internet connections & older phones.  Worth noting that Twitter in India &amp; many other countries is slow even on latest iPhone.",1
32,"Starlink is rebuilding the Internet in space, so maybe I know slightly more than some guy who wrote code for a website",1
33,"There are ~1200 'microservices' server side, of which ~40 are critical to Twitter working at all, according to server control team. Trimming down that 1200 number, reducing data usage, serialized trips & simplifying app are all needed to improve speed of use.",1
34,"Twitter is very slow in India, Indonesia &amp; many other countries. This is fact, not 'claim'.  10 to 15 secs to refresh homeline tweets is common. Sometimes, it doesn't work at all, especially on Android phones.  Only question is how much delay is due to bandwidth/latency/app.",0
35,"Yes, although it seemed almost impossible at times",1
36,Why is Twitter unusably slow in many countries? Seems odd that this would be bandwidth only.,0
37,"Next test is ~20 sec firing with max oxygen fill to test autogenous pressurization, possibly one more static fire, then orbital launch attempt",1
38,"This is an external analysis, not from Twitter. It is lower than Twitter's published mDAU.",0
39,"In some parts of the world, refresh takes 30 seconds",0
40,How many serial requests are made by app to refresh timeline?,1
41,And we will finally stop adding what device a tweet was written on (waste of screen space &amp; compute) below every tweet. Literally no one even knows why we did that …,0
42,Part of today will be turning off the “microservices” bloatware. Less than 20% are actually needed for Twitter to work!,1
43,"I was told ~1200 RPCs independently by several engineers at Twitter, which matches  of microservices. The ex-employee is wrong.  Same app in US takes ~2 secs to refresh (too long), but ~20 secs in India, due to bad batching/verbose comms. Actually useful data transferred is low.",0
44,I have Tesla covered too. Will be there part of this week.,1
45,"True, the food is great.  The fact that you don't realize that there are up to 1200 'microservices' being called when someone uses the Twitter app is not great.",0
46,SpaceX Starlink bought a tiny 'not large' ad package to test effectiveness of Twitter advertising in Australia &amp; Spain. Did same for FB/Insta/Google.,1
47,Twitter is super slow on Android. What have you done to fix that?,0
48,Then please correct me. What is the right number?,0
49,"False. Twitter spends $13M/year on food service for SF HQ. Badge in records show peak occupancy was 25%, average occupancy below 10%.  There are more people preparing breakfast than eating breakfast.

They don’t even bother serving dinner, because there is no one in the building.",0
50,Increasing granularity about what 'verified' actually means is the right move,1
51,Especially bizarre given that almost no one came to the office. Estimated cost per lunch served in past 12 months is &gt;$400.,0
52,"I hope they keep cursing me on Twitter, as it increases advertising revenue!",1
53,We will enable organizations to manage affiliations,1
54,"Output of any company is the vector sum of people within it. Someone may be a strong vector, but negatively affect those around them to such a degree that they are a net negative.",0
55,"Btw, I'd like to apologize for Twitter being super slow in many countries. App is doing & 1000 poorly batched RPCs just to render a home timeline!",0
56,"Ultimately, I think there is no choice but for Twitter to be the final arbiter, but I’m open to suggestions",0
57,"Rolling out soon, Twitter will enable organizations to identify which other Twitter accounts are actually associated with them",1
58,"Amphetamines negatively affect empathy, psychedelics do the opposite",0
59,Are you suggesting the Senator will abuse his political power to attack me?,0
60,"I like both you and Mike! It's just that Twitter at its core is a software & servers company. The technology needs to evolve rapidly, which requires a technologist.",1
61,"SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation",0
62,Perhaps it is because your real account sounds like a parody?,0
63,Going without saying that we all want ASS (Actually Smart Summon) ASAP!!,1
64,Making Tesla Superchargers & connectors available to all is the right thing to do,1
65,Spaces should be evolve. It has potential to be truly great.,1
66,"This is false. Anyone who can be in office, should be. However, if not logistically possible or they have essential personal matters, then staying home is fine.  Working remotely is also ok if their manager vouches for excellence.  Same policy as Tesla & SpaceX.",1
67,"Given all that is in V11, it will take a few weeks to expand the beta, then another few weeks to go wide release to US & Canada",0

70,FTX meltdown/ransack being tracked in real-time on Twitter,0
71,"Accurate. He set off my bs detector, which is why I did not think he had $3B.",0
72,"Full answer to insulin price question is complex. Short answer is that original insulin, discovered in 1921 (not 1923), is inexpensive, costing as little as $25.   New, higher efficacy analog variants of insulin are more expensive. 

",0
73,It used to be:  'Internet guy will fail at rockets/cars!'  Now it is:  'Rockets/cars guy will fail at Internet!'  Literally from same media outlets,0
74,Happy Veterans Day to all those who have served!,1
75,Maybe should be default off? Subscriber is a way better name.,1
76,"In pursuit of our mission, today we are opening up our EV connector design",1
77,Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!,1
78,Thank you.  A thermonuclear name & shame is exactly what will happen if this continues.,0
79,"Regarding Twitter's reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.  Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required.",1
80,"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter's strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.  In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press.",1
81,"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.  Extremely messed up! They're trying to destroy free speech in America.",1
82,Unsure if confirming or denying that I'm an alien is more convincing that I'm an alien,0
83,"Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic super-intelligence",1

85,The entitled elite is not mad that they have to pay $8/month. They're mad that anyone can pay $8/month.,0
86,Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That's why you're reading this tweet right now.,1
87,Still a fair bit of polish to be done on 69.3. It's a major release posing as a minor release.,1
88,"If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they'll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!  We will definitely add cool stuff like what you're suggesting to Twitter Blue.",1
89,Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints,1
90,"The community notes feature is awesome.  Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation.",1
91,"Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence",1
92,"Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks",1
93,Talked to civil society leaders Ken Hersch & about how Twitter will continue to combat hate & harassment & enforce its election integrity policies,1
94,We're staying vigilant against attempts to manipulate conversations about the 2022 US midterms. Read on for independent analysis,1
95,"There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians",1
96,"Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam, that account will be suspended.   Essentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude.",1
97,Twitter's current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit.  Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.,0
98,"Heavy launches USSF-44 to orbit, and its two side boosters return to Earth SpaceX's 50th mission of 2022",1
99,I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls.,1
100,"We've all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs.",1
101,"Good point.   Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating.   The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected, then modified by user feedback.",1
102,Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.   No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.,1
103,"The New York Times has emerged as a new, chaotic actor in global politics. The paper's interventions in some of the world's most combustible conflicts have sometimes been a boon, but their messaging has also caused problems.",0
104,A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias,1
