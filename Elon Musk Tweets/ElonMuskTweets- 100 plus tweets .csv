  Birdwatch (soon to be renamed Community Notes) has incredible potential for improving information accuracy on Twitter!

Power to the People
Full-scale Hyperloop Testing has begun 
 I try my best
Thank you.  A thermonuclear name & shame is exactly what will happen if this continues.
"Regarding Twitter's reduction in force, unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4M/day.  Everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required."
    Twitter will not censor accurate information about anything
"Again, to be crystal clear, Twitter's strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.  In fact, we have actually seen hateful speech at times this week decline *below* our prior norms, contrary to what you may read in the press."
Excellent summary of Twitter's Trust & Safety from the head of the team 
" Hank, try a Google search"
Life at Starbase  
 Agreed. Working on it.
 And therefore Twitter should die?
 You're right
"Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.  Extremely messed up! They're trying to destroy free speech in America."
 Absolutely
 That assessment is more accurate than most people realize
 Unsure if confirming or denying that I'm an alien is more convincing that I'm an alien
 maybe we're already in it
 I'm an alien trying to get back to my home planet
  There are in fact 2 agendas
Tiny talk is talk so small it feels like it's coming from your own mind
  What can I say? It was a naked abuse of power.
Why is small talk even legal!?
A neuron doesn't realize it's a neuron
" Pretty much, or at least one of the hive minds"
with a lot of room for improvement
"Because it consists of billions of bidirectional interactions per day, Twitter can be thought of as a collective, cybernetic super-intelligence"
"  True, Twitter has amazing content in Japan roughly half of all adults online but it's almost never seen outside of Japan"
The entitled elite is not mad that they have to pay $8/month. They're mad that anyone can pay $8/month.

" Your feedback is appreciated, now pay $8"

Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the Internet. That's why you're reading this tweet right now.
 The system is working
Being attacked by both right & left simultaneously is a good sign
 Quite a few companies like this
 Works every time
  Capital allocation should be done by those best at doing so
  Still a fair bit of polish to be done on 69.3. It's a major release posing as a minor release.
 Some good ideas here
you get what you pay for
"If verified accounts violate terms of service, eg spam/scam/impersonation, they'll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!  We will definitely add cool stuff like what you're suggesting to Twitter Blue."
 Thanks Michael
 Absolutely agreed that the Twitter safety board should have people from all viewpoints
 Exactly!
"The community notes feature is awesome.  Our goal is to make Twitter the most accurate source of information on Earth, without regard to political affiliation."
"         Twitter's content moderation council will include representatives with widely divergent views, which will certainly include the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence"
"         Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks"
 Talked to civil society leaders Ken Hersch & about how Twitter will continue to combat hate & harassment & enforce its election integrity policies
 I think so
 Exactly!
Twitter speaks to the inner masochist in all of us
   It's the user's own setting that did this
Totally stole idea of charging for insults & arguments from Monty Python tbh 
"To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8"
We're staying vigilant against attempts to manipulate conversations about the 2022 US midterms. Read on for independent analysis
 Yup
 That already happens very frequently
Falcon Heavy is a testament to the awesomeness of humanity
 Sounds like a good idea
Wow that was amazing 
"There will be a secondary tag below the name for someone who is a public figure, which is already the case for politicians"
"Yes, this will destroy the bots. If a paid Blue account engages in spam/scam, that account will be suspended.   Essentially, this raises the cost of crime on Twitter by several orders of magnitude."
 Absolutely essential. Creators need to make a living!
This will also give Twitter a revenue stream to reward content creators
  Exactly
And paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with us
"You will also get:
- Priority in replies, mentions & search, which is essential to defeat spam/scam
- Ability to post long video & audio
- Half as many ads"
Price adjusted by country proportionate to purchasing power parity
Twitter's current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn't have a blue checkmark is bullshit.  Power to the people! Blue for $8/month.
"Heavy launches USSF-44 to orbit, and its two side boosters return to Earth SpaceX's 50th mission of 2022 "
Sonic BOOMS!! 
Falcon Heavy launch in ~30 mins 
 I will explain the rationale in longer form before this is implemented. It is the only way to defeat the bots & trolls.
 We need to pay the bills somehow! Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?
Halloween with my Mom 
"  I confess, it's all my fault"
 I recommend following  for the most accurate understanding of what's happening with trust & safety at Twitter
 I hate sarcasm so much you can't believe it
Happy Halloween transformerskids on Instagram 
 For now
    Definitely
  Looking into it
 This is just temporary
Twitter's commitment to brand safety is unchanged
Heavy rolling up the ramp ahead of tomorrow's targeted launch of the USSF-44 mission; weather is 90% favorable for liftoff
"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!"
" The Guardian used to have balance (moderately left) and integrity, but now it is a far left wing propaganda machine. I hope they get back to where they were one day."
" Oh no, all our diabolical plans have been revealed!!"
 What could we do to make it better than TikTok?
 Interesting
 He sucks!!!
Bring back Vine?
"We've all made some questionable tweets, me more than most, but I want to be clear that I support Yoel. My sense is that he has high integrity, and we are all entitled to our political beliefs."
"& Twitter board deliberately hid this evidence from the court. Stay tuned, more to come"
" All news has bias, some more than others"
This is fake I did *not* tweet out a link to The New York Times! 
  I've now been through so many hero to villain cycles I've lost count
 What an incredible creature!
  The whole verification process is being revamped right now
 This is false

 My title is Chief Twit right there in the bio. No idea who the CEO is.
So demanding to allow a mere 30 days to learn this priceless information!
"Just received this email from Twitter. This is an actual, real email that was autogenerated "
"I will look into this. Twitter should be even-handed, favoring neither side."
 Absolutely

"Finally, the truth that carbs are amazing can be said on this platform! 
FreeSpeech"
Fresh baked bread & pastries are some of the great joys of life
" Good point.   Being able to select which version of Twitter you want is probably better, much as it would be for a movie maturity rating.   The rating of the tweet itself could be self-selected, then modified by user feedback."
 One of the best trolls ever
 Something like this makes sense
 Ace reporting by
"To be super clear, we have not yet made any changes to Twitter's content moderation policies "
 Sorry about that. Fixing as fast as possible!
Ligma Johnson had it coming
  Anyone suspended for minor & dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail
Comedy is now legal on Twitter
"Solar Powerwall ensures you never lose power, even if the grid goes down"
 Yes account was restored by Twitter before the acquisition. They did not consult with or inform me.
Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.   No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.
 !
 Cool!
 First I've heard
let the good times roll
 I will be digging in more today
the bird is freed

Dear Twitter Advertisers 
Meeting a lot of cool people at Twitter today!
Entering Twitter HQ let that sink in! 
 Definitely closer to citizen journalism local news orgs are under-appreciated & should get way more prominence on Twitter
 Nobody bats 1000
A beautiful thing about Twitter is how it empowers citizen journalism people are able to disseminate news without an establishment bias
 I'm a big fan of citizen journalism!
According to unnamed sources close to the matter who wish to remain anonymous
"The New York Times has emerged as a new, chaotic actor in global politics. The paper's interventions in some of the world's most combustible conflicts have sometimes been a boon, but their messaging has also caused problems."
  Yes!
 30% is a lot

Works on any moving land object
